6. How many ways are there to select five unordered elements from a set with three elements when repetition is allowed?\\\\
$C(3 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(7,5) = C(7,2) = \frac{7!}{2! * 5!} = 21$\\\\
8. How many different ways are there to choose a dozen donuts from the 21 varieties at a donut shop?\\\\
$C(12 + 21 - 1, 12) = C(32,12) = \frac{32!}{12! * 20!} = 225792840$\\\\
12. How many different combinations of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and half dollars can a piggy bank contain if it has 20 coins in it?\\\\
$C(5 + 20 - 1, 20) = C(24, 20) = C(24,4) = \frac{24!}{4! * 20!} = 10626$\\\\
14. How many solutions are there to the equation $x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 17$\\\\
$C(4 + 17 - 1, 17) = C(20,3) = \frac{20!}{3! * 17!} = 1140$
